##Introduction
In this chapter, we introduce the F# language and learn how to get our first program up and running. 
In doing so, we will discuss the basic rules around F# program structure and the essential tools you will need to develop rudimentary applications. 
As we progress through the book, and our experience grows, we will delve more deeply into code examples, tool examples, etc.

##Overview of F#
F# is a strongly typed, first-class .NET programming language designed by Don Syme and others at Microsoft Research.
It has its origins in the [ML approach to language design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_programming_language) and is a close relative of [OCaml](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml).

While billed primarily as a functional language, F# is in actuality a multi-paradigm language. 
This means that it supports imperative, OO, and functional styles of programming. 
A fully supported .NET language in its own right, F# interoperates naturally with code written in other .NET languages such as C# and VB.NET.

F# is available as part of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. 
You can find the most recent F# Language Reference [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233181). 
For this book, all the code was tested with build 4.0.40219.1 in Visual Studio 2010.

Please consult the language reference for the basic rules and regulations of F#, e.g. the rules around defining a valid symbolic name, etc.
