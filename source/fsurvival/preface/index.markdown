I've been meaning to learn about F# for a while now and I discovered the excellant resource that is F# Survival guide. I figured I would use this opportunity to learn about F# and 
functional programming by reviving this guide.

Just to be clear, I am merely replicating and maybe updating the material that was originally created by the guys at CTO Corner. 
The internets tried to contact these guys to try and revive the site but to no avail.
My goal is to take the content from the web archive wayback machine and make it alive again.
You can find the original content on the wayback machine [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20110708212837/http://www.ctocorner.com/fsharp/book/default.aspx).

So even though the blog copyright notice at the bottom has my name, just to be clear, the content for the F# survivial guide was originally created by ctocorner.com

So without further delay, welcome to the [F# Survival Guide](/fsurvival/toc).
